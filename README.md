Android app


The goal of this project is to develop an Android application that serves as a medium between restaurants and its customers. In almost every restaurant, it is common to find a huge crowd of people waiting for their food orders. This results in huge waiting times and also violates the social distancing norms that are imposed considering the ongoing pandemic.

To minimize the waiting time as well as to avoid the gathering of people, this app allows customers to order the food from their favorite restaurants sitting at the comfort of their homes. Once the food is ordered, the app gives the waiting time based on the item and the number of current orders. This helps the customers in reaching the restaurants at correct time and avoiding the long queue at the restaurant.

Along with this, the app also lets the users to search for the restaurants based on the location. This allows them to pick a restaurant that is near to their home which in turn reduces the travelling cost and time. The app also allows users to complete the payment transactions and thus avoiding the in-person cash exchange.
